ResolvBot collects information such as user IDs, server IDs, and any other information that is required to provide the features of the bot. Your Guild Information and User Data is stored on our secure servers. Any personal data that is considered private is encrypted and cannot be accessed by anyone unless required. We do not share or sell any information collected by the bot to third parties, except as required by law.

When making a purchase through our bot, payment is processed through Stripe. Stripe is a secure, PCI-compliant payment processor that is used by thousands of businesses worldwide. When you make a purchase through our bot, your personal and payment information is collected and stored by Stripe, not by us. This information can only be accessed by authorized personnel at Stripe, the Billing Manager and our Founders and is subject to strict security and privacy standards. We do not collect or store any payment information ourselves and Stripe will never let you view the full credit/debit card information, other than the last 4 digits for security purposes. 

At any time, users can request that their personal data be deleted from our systems. To make a request, please contact us through our Discord Support Tickets: https://resolvbot.xyz/support, or through email at: np@resolvbot.xyz. We will respond to your request as quickly as possible, and will take all necessary steps to delete your personal data from our systems. Please note that some data, such as data needed for financial and legal compliance, may be retained for a period of time as required by law. If you have any questions about our data deletion policy or procedures, please don't hesitate to contact us.
